# Technical Memo 3.1

## Problem:
**Generating Lending and Authors IDs in different formats** based on varying specifications.

## Summary of Solutions:
To generate IDs for lending and authors according to different formatting requirements, the following approaches are proposed:
- **Implement format-specific generation rules** for each type of ID;
- **Create reusable utility functions** that abstract the ID generation process and can be configured for different formats;
- **Ensure unique and valid IDs** across all formats through validation and error-checking mechanisms.

## Solution:
1. **Format-specific rules:**
    - Define rules for how each type of ID should be formatted. For instance:
            
    - - This ensures the generated IDs comply with each use case's requirements.

2. **Reusable utility functions:**
    - Develop utility functions or services that allow the configuration of ID generation parameters (e.g., prefix, suffix, format type, length).
    - This can be done using a factory pattern, where the ID generation logic is centralized but flexible enough to handle the differences between Lending and Author IDs.

3. **Validation and error-checking:**
    - Integrate a validation mechanism to ensure that each generated ID is unique and conforms to the expected format.
    - This can be achieved through regular expression checks or specific ID validation libraries.
    - Additionally, maintain a log of generated IDs to prevent duplication and ensure traceability.

## Motivation:
- **Consistency** in the way IDs are generated across the system, reducing the risk of invalid or duplicate IDs.
- **Scalability**, allowing for the easy addition of new formats or ID specifications as the system evolves.

## Pending Issues:

1. **System dependencies:**
    - Ensure that the ID generation utility is not tightly coupled to specific database or storage mechanisms, allowing it to be easily extended or modified without affecting other parts of the system.

## Conclusion:
By adopting a strategy where ID generation is flexible, reusable, and well-defined according to specific formats, the system can easily handle varying specifications for Lending and Author IDs. This approach ensures maintainability and scalability as the system grows or as new formatting requirements are introduced.
