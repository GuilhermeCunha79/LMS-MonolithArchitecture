Problem: Persisting data in different data models (e.g. relational, document) and SGBD (e.g.MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis)

Summary of solutions:
    Adopt the following tatics:
        - Reduce coupling namely:
            - Use intermediary;
            - Abstract common services
            - Defer binding

Solution:
    - Use intermediary
    - Use abstract common services because:
    - Defer binding because: addresses configuration

Motivation:
    - Adopt the same codebase for different clients that have constraints in the data model and DBMS.

Pending issues:
    - How difficult and long will be the refactoring of current solution to adopt other persistence data models and DBMS?
    - What are the parts of the system that requires modification?
    - What data models and DBMS should be supported? (According to the Product Owner, non-relational (document) and relational should be supported. Such as: H2, Oracle, MS SQL, Mongo DB)
